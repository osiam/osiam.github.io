title:  "New Location for OSIAM Snapshot Builds"
---

Until now, we distributed the latest build of OSIAM under a stable URL on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/osiam).
But unfortunately, Bintray only allows updates to a published artifact for 180 days.
So this idea did not work out. 
This means we have to stop publishing the latest snapshot to Bintray.

Fortunately, the latest OSIAM build is also available in the [JFrog OSS Repository](https://oss.jfrog.org/repo/org/osiam/osiam/latest-SNAPSHOT/).
Just scroll down to the bottom of the page and select the latest WAR file.
We will find another solution to distribute the latest build under a stable URL.
