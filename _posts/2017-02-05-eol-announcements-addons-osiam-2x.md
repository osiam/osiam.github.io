title:  "End-of-life of Add-Ons and OSIAM 2.x"
---

We officially announce the end-of-life of OSIAM 2.x and the Add-Ons.
OSIAM 3.0 was released about 6 Months ago.
Since then, no further updates were made to OSIAM 2.x.
There were also no significant support requests.
It seems that the time has come to end the lifecycle of OSIAM 2.x.
Additionally, it turned out that the add-ons provide services, that are mandatory for an IAM.
Thus, they should not be provided by add-ons but be integrated into OSIAM.
The following end-of-life dates have been set:

End-of-life of Add-On Administration and Self Administration takes effect immediately.
Starting today, there will be no further updates to the codebase.
This is also true for critical or security bugs.
All effort will be put into the integration of the add-ons into OSIAM.
We generally have given up on the idea of providing additional services by running separate applications.

End-of-life of OSIAM 2.x will take effect on April 2nd, 2017.
After this date, there will be no further updates to the codebase.
This is also true for critical or security bugs.
There will also be no support for OSIAM 2.x via GitHub issues anymore.
All users are encouraged to update to OSIAM 3.x as soon as possible.
