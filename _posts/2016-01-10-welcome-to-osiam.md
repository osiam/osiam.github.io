title:  "Welcome to OSIAM!"
---

Welcome to OSIAM's new website.

We are going to blog here from now on about things like:

- New releases and upcoming changes in OSIAM and its components
- Rationales behind architectural decisions
- How-tos, tutorials and case studies showing you how to get the best out of OSIAM

We are are going to constantly improve this website.
Some plans for the future are:

- Allowing comments on blog posts with Disqus
- Hosting the documentation of OSIAM and its components
- Making it fancier and linking to the external services we use
