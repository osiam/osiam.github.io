title:  "OSIAM 3.0 Release Date"
---

We have finally set the release date for OSIAM 3.0: It will be on April 30th 2016 (2016-04-30).
Of course, it's done, when it's done, but we will try hard to stay on schedule.
Starting today we are also in feature freeze.
This means that no new features or changes will be accepted for 3.0 from now on.
To the end of April, we will cut off the last rough edges and resolve the remaining issues, that are scheduled for 3.0.

So, stay tuned and watch the progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/osiam/osiam).
